This reduces the demand for new raw materials and lowers the environmental footprint.\\n- The fabric is **breathable, quick-drying, and abrasion-resistant**, which enhances durability and extends the lifespan of the garment, reducing the need for frequent replacements.\\n- The inclusion of **Lycra® spandex** ensures long-lasting elasticity, which contributes to the garment’s durability and fit retention, further reducing waste.\\n\\nOverall, the use of recycled materials and high-performance fibers makes this swimwear both eco-friendly and sustainable.\\nTRUE ANSWER: The Refresh Swimwear V-Neck Tankini Top is constructed using 82% recycled nylon and 18% Lycra® spandex for the body, and 90% recycled nylon with 10% Lycra® spandex for the lining. The use of recycled nylon makes the fabric environmentally friendly, as it reduces waste and the need for new raw materials, while the Lycra® spandex provides stretch and comfort.\\nGRADE:\"\n",

This technology ensures that the pants are \\\"Air In. Water Out,\\\" meaning they allow air to permeate while preventing water from penetrating, keeping the wearer dry and comfortable regardless of the activity or weather conditions.\\nTRUE ANSWER: Two key features of the EcoFlex 3L Storm Pants are the three-layer shell that delivers waterproof protection and the brand new TEK O2 technology, which enhances breathability to keep the wearer dry and comfortable. TEK O2 technology works by being air-permeable, allowing moisture vapor to escape while preventing water from entering, ensuring comfort across different activities and weather conditions.\\nGRADE:\"\n",
